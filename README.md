# CatCaaaat!!
This Python code retrieves a random cat image and its breed information from TheCatAPI and displays a toast notification that includes the breed name, origin, description, and a link (if available). The notification also displays the downloaded cat image and plays a random meowing sound.

## Getting Started
You will also need to obtain an API key from TheCatAPI. You can get a free API key by creating an account on their website.
